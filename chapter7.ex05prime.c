 * Author: Rafael Mar√≠. *
 * *
 * Purpose: Compute a program that tells if a number is prime or not. *
 * *
 * Usage: *
 * Run the program, enter number and it appears if it is prime or not. *

  if (num==4) return 0; // If the number is 4, it is not a prime number
  for (int x=2; x<num/2; x++) { // We create a loop from 2 to half the entered number
    if (num%x==0) return 0; //If the number can be divided with a remainder of 0, then it is not a prime number
